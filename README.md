Overview

This repository includes various C programming projects designed to solve real-world computational problems and explore fundamental concepts such as binary arithmetic, linked lists, hash tables, and dynamic memory allocation. Each project is implemented with robust, efficient, and modular C code, accompanied by explanations and sample input-output files.

Features

Conversion of numbers to binary representation with specific constraints
Handling signed and unsigned number conversions
IEEE-754 floating-point representation and conversions
Determination of right truncatable primes
Implementation of sorted linked lists
Hash table creation using chaining for collision resolution
Matrix multiplication using dynamic memory allocation

Projects

1. Binary Representation
Convert numbers into binary format with user-defined constraints.
Includes signed and unsigned number conversions.
2. IEEE-754 Floating-Point Representation
Represent numbers in IEEE-754 single-precision format.
Perform conversions between decimal and floating-point representations.
3. Right Truncatable Primes
Algorithm to determine and validate right truncatable primes.
4. Sorted Linked List
Implement sorted linked lists with dynamic insertion and deletion.
5. Hash Table with Chaining
Design a hash table that resolves collisions using separate chaining.
6. Matrix Multiplication
Perform matrix multiplication using dynamically allocated memory.
Each folder in the repository contains:
